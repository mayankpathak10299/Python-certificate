# Python-certificate-
While hosting or conducting an event, writing certificates to delegates is a frustrating job. Well, in my case it’s a pain in the neck. So I found a way to automate this task using a simple Python program.
<br>
**Requirements:**
<li>Python (better if you have latest)<br>
To install python goto: https://www.python.org/downloads/
<li>Download and install<br>
The latest version of python comes with pip, so no need to download pip.</li>
<li>Python Pillow Library<br>
To install PIL, execute this in terminal/cmd :
> pip install Pillow</li>
<li>A certificate image<br>
Image of said certificate with blank name field [image attribute]</li>
<li>
TTF font file<br>
A TrueType font file of the font which we will use to print names,or you can use any downloaded font
</li>
